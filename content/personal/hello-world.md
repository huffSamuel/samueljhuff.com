Hey 👋, I'm Sam. Any given day I embody a lot of different roles: Dad, husband, software engineer, shadetree mechanic, chef, chicken rancher. This blog is a digital repository of the things I've learned, failed to learn, or am working on learning.

If you're here for Jeep hacks, clean code, high desert gardening tips, or just some stream of consciousness observations, you're in the right place.

### What will you find here?
I hope you find some little nuggets of wisdom that help you in accomplish your goals. More likely, you'll probably find yourself saying "Why did he think that would ever work?" while I document how I did things the wrong way. Stay tuned for:

- 💻 API design, architecture, experiments, and the occasional self-inflicted bugs.

- 🐓 Automation, coop builds, and generally how to keep the hens happy.

- ⛟ '90s car projects, Jeep mods, and how to make more work for yourself under that shadetree.

- 🥗 Recipes I've found, created, or adapted that keep toddlers, and adults, fed.

- 🌱 High desert gardening successes and failures.

### What won't you find here?
I really suck at <span class="italic">the algorithm</span> so you won't see any clickbait titles, affiliate links, ads, sponsored segments, or AI slop. You'll find actual things that my family or I have experienced and actual real-world outcomes. If you find any of the information here helpful, you can <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/samuel_huff">buy me a coffee</a>.

### Why share this info?
Honestly, I don't know. Maybe I needed another project to work on (not likely) or maybe I just wanted to open myself up to the scrutiny of the internet. I do hope this is a better long term memory storage system than my brain so I can look back on this in the future to see where I started and how far I've come.

Enjoy. Or don't. I'm the author, not a cop.
