    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! üëã I'm <span class="me">Samuel Huff</span>, a software engineer,
      car enthusiast, and coffee enjoyer based out of central Oregon.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife and I have two wonderful children, and together the four of us
      grow crops, raise animals, and otherwise life a quiet life on our little
      parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not looking for full time work at this time, but I can lend a
      part-time hand building or consulting on your project. Reach out to me through the
      <a href="/contact">contact form</a> and I'll get back to you after I catch this chicken üêî.
